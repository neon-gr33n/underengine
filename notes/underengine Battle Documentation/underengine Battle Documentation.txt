## Setting up enemy encounter 
To create an enemy that you can encounter/battle, there's several steps you'll need to follow, let's go through them in order

First, you have to create an object, and make the parent `obj_parent_battle_enemy`, we'll get back to the object in a short while
but for now, let's create the struct- the data that is actually used to **create** the encounter and allows the enemy to work in encounter_setup()

To make an enemy struct, you'll need to go into enemy_data_init and add one, let's say for example, Froggit, from Undertale

```gml
	  FROGGIT: {
		    NAME: loc_gettext("enemy.name.froggit"),
		    OBJECT: obj_battle_enemy_froggit,
		    XP_GAIN: 5,
		    GOLD_GAIN: 4,
		    STATS: {
		        HP: 50,
		        MAX_HP: 50,
		        ATK: 4,
		        DEF: 1,
		    },
    
		    ACTS: {
		        // Each ACT has: name, responses, and mercy requirements
		        "Check": {
					display_name: function() { return loc_gettext("bt.act.check"); // Check },
		            responses: [
		               loc_gettext("enemy.froggit.act.check.response") 
		            ],
		            mercy_effect: 0,
		            repeatable: false
		        },
		        "Threaten": {
					display_name: function() { return loc_gettext("bt.act.threaten"); // Threaten },
		            responses: [
		                loc_gettext("enemy.froggit.act.threaten.response.0"), // * Froggit didn't understand what you said# but was scared anyway.
		            ],
		            mercy_effect: 0,
		            repeatable: true
		        },
			   "Compliment": {
				   	display_name: function() { return loc_gettext("bt.act.compliment"); // Compliment },
		            responses: [
						loc_gettext("enemy.froggit.act.compliment.response.0"), // * Froggit didn't understand what you said# but was flattered anyway.
		            ],
		            mercy_effect: 1,
		            repeatable: true
		        },
		    },
    
		    // MERCY SYSTEM
		    MERCY_REQUIREMENTS: {
		        required_acts: ["Compliment"],
		        required_count: 1,
		        custom_check: function(enemy_state) {
					return array_contains(enemy_state.completed_acts, "Compliment");
		        }
		    },
    
			SPARE_WITH_ALLY: false,
		    DESCRIPTION: "Froggit reluctantly approaches!"
		},
```

This defines ALL of the necessary data to make Froggit both show up in the select menus in battle, and have interactions with the player

Now you might be wondering about the object itself? well, the logic in there is yours to decide, just remember a few things
- Event user 0 (Init) initializes enemy specific data and initial flavor text (the text shown when you first encounter the enemy)
- Event user 3 (Turn Start) is where you setup your special logic for the turn starting, could be anything you feel is necessary, but always make sure to initialize a battle turn object 

Make sure to review the parameters in `obj_parent_battle_enemy`'s create event carefully, and make sure you set them as needed in User event 0 of your enemy object
Things like hurtSprite, and hurtSound are good to mess with if you have custom assets for when the enemy takes damage

The draw event is where you draw your enemy, handle it as you see fit, and get creative! 

We recommend reviewing all enemy related functions (such as those in enemy_act_funcs) to understand how to accomplish more complex behaviors
