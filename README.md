### Getting Started
Firstly, install GameMaker: Studio 2 if you haven't already, and as a sidenote: you may need a subscription if you didn't previously purchase the software off of steam, or a similar platform
during the era when perpetual licenses were being sold- refer to this page for further information regarding this: https://gamemaker.io/en/get 

After installing GameMaker: Studio 2, you can go ahead and get started! simply download or clone this repo onto your computer, in a folder where it's easily accessible to you, extract the .zip file that you downloaded, and you should have a folder called "underengine-main", if all looks good, then all you really need to do is open the project file!

And just like that, you're good to go! You're now able to go ahead and start making your very own UNDERTALE fangame! Feel free to explore! modify MACROS.gml to suit your needs, and check out the documentation as well (wip)
